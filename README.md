# TypeWriter
This is a simple software which types the content passed in input file for the user. A solution for content writing type of jobs where copy paste is not allowed. 


FEATURES:
- Simple user interface with 'yes' and 'no' button to start typint from inut file and 'text box' to take the input file number to read from
- if no integer is passed inside 'text box' no typing will be carried out.
- Input files are to be named as - input1.txt, input2.txt, input3.txr and so on..
-  Currently supports 10 input file no less and  no more


REQUIRMENTS:
- Python interpreter needes to be installed and set up to use this software (I am using python 3.8)
- Link to dowload- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- install following modules (by running following command in cmd of windows or terminal of linux):
-  - pip install keyboard



HOW TO USE:
- Run the .py file using vscode or cmd
- user interface will open
- before proceeding copy paste the content to be typed in input files- input1.txt, input2.txt, input3.txt...
- type the number in 'Text Box' for the input file to be choosen, like - 1 for input1.txt and so on.
- the .py file and input files should be in same folder
- click 'yes' button after entering the integer in 'text box'
- Now place the cursor on the notepad (anywhere you want it to type) and press 'ctrl+y' to start typing
- * It supports professional content typing softwares also

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:
- once start typing place the dont disturb the pc as the process cannot be stopped till the content is typed
- once all the 10 inputs are used and typed from then only you can re-use the input files to print from them
- once the typing from an input file is completed it cannot be typed again from an becomes de-activated till all 10 files are used up in typing
- * If you have pressed 'yes' button and want to change the 'text box' input or go back use 'ctrl+k' short cut to de activate 'yes' button
- * You cannot use 'ctrl+k' short cut once started tuping by pressing 'ctrl+y'
